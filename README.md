# Project Title:

Smart Invoice Data Entry Bot with ERPNext API Integration

## üìù Project Description:

This project automates the end-to-end process of invoice handling using Robotic Process Automation (RPA) powered by UiPath, integrated with ERPNext via its RESTful API.

Instead of relying on traditional UI automation, this solution focuses on direct API interaction with ERPNext to achieve faster, more reliable, and scalable data entry. The bot extracts structured data from PDF invoices using UiPath‚Äôs Document Understanding capabilities, validates the data, and then posts it to ERPNext using secure API calls to create purchase invoices and attach documents programmatically.

This modern automation approach significantly improves accuracy, eliminates UI-related failures, and accelerates invoice processing.

## üéØ Project Objective:

‚úÖ Automate Invoice Processing: Eliminate manual invoice entry and reduce turnaround time.

‚úÖ Enhance Stability with API: Minimize UI dependencies by integrating ERPNext via API for data input.

‚úÖ Ensure Data Accuracy: Validate supplier and invoice data before entry.

‚úÖ Improve Traceability: Log API response status and invoice IDs for auditing.

‚úÖ Boost Scalability: Support high-volume invoice processing with a resilient automation pipeline.

## Tools & Technologies:

RPA Platform: UiPath Studio & Orchestrator

ERP System: ERPNext (via API)

Document Processing: UiPath Document Understanding / OCR (for scanned PDFs)

Storage: Local folder, shared drive, or email inbox (as PDF source)
